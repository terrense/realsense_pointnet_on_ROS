# PointNet with ROS Integration

This project demonstrates the integration of PointNet with ROS to process point clouds obtained from a Realsense D455 camera. The PointNet model is used to segment potential movable objects such as humans, robots, and chairs.

## Features
- Implementation of PointNet using PyTorch
- Integration with ROS
- Processing of point clouds from Realsense D455 camera

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or later
- PyTorch
- ROS Noetic
- Realsense ROS package
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Setup

1. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
